# Implementation 

The website is implemented in GitHub Pages using Jekyll with Minima layout. This repo contains all relevant files and codes required to deploy the website.

The blog posts and website pages are coded in one of the three formats: `html` files,`ipynb` notebooks,  or `md` markdown pages. The notebooks and markdown posts are converted to `html` with GitHub actions with help of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), which allows publishing blog posts as Jupyter notebooks. 

The website includes several customizations, including:
- the dark/light theme toggle
- site-wide search
- customly designed menu pages
- dynamic layout changes depending on the screen size.
